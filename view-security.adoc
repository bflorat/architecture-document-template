## Introduction
This is the security point of view. It describes all the measures implemented to prevent unauthorized use, misuse, illegitimate modification or misappropriation of application modules.
The other views of the document are accessible link:./README.adoc[from here].
The project glossary is available link:glossary.adoc[here]. We will not redefine the functional or technical terms used here.
[TIP]
Availability is dealt with in the infrastructure section. Even if availability concept is often handled with Integrity and Confidentiality (the "CIA triad"), this model is role-oriented and we feel that availability is more often managed by infrastructure architects than by the security experts.

## Constraints

[TIP]
====
List here the **security constraints** applicable to the architecture, including in particular:

- **Module isolation** within secured network zones (_DMZ, firewalls, reverse proxy, network segmentation, etc._).  
- **Applicable standards and policies** (_e.g., password policies, encryption requirements, MFA, compliance with security standards_).  
- **Legal and regulatory constraints** (_e.g., GDPR compliance, industry-specific requirements_).  
- **Access restrictions** between different zones and systems.  
====

====
Example 1: The password management policy must comply with standard `XYZ`, including minimum complexity and periodic renewal.  
====

====
Example 2: A module in the **Internet zone** is strictly prohibited from directly accessing the **Intranet zone**.  
====

====
Example 3: In application of the **GDPR**, user data must be encrypted **at rest and in transit** using **AES-256 and TLS 1.3**.  
====

## Requirements

[TIP]
====
Present here the **requirements**, *not the measures or controls addressing them*.  
Those will be detailed in Chapter 3.  

For particularly sensitive projects, prepare a **risk analysis dossier**.  

Possible methodologies include:  

* The **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** (NIST SP 800-37) or **ISO/IEC 27005** for information security risk management.  
* The https://cyber.gouv.fr/en/publications/ebios-risk-manager-method[EBIOS Risk Manager] (_Expression of Needs and Identification of Security Objectives_) method.

### Integrity Requirements

[TIP]
====
Integrity refers to the **accuracy, durability, and trustworthiness** of the application’s data.

Guaranteeing data integrity means ensuring that data **cannot be altered or deleted** either unintentionally (_e.g., disk crash, software corruption, application bug_) or intentionally (_e.g., man-in-the-middle attack, privilege escalation, insider sabotage_).

⚠ **Do not multiply data classes unnecessarily**. A single classification for the entire application is often sufficient.

.Required integrity level by data class (example)
[cols='2e,1e,1e,1e,1e']
|===
|Data Class |Non-Integral [small]#(Integrity errors are tolerated)# |Detectable [small]#(Errors are quickly identified)# |Controlled [small]#(Errors are corrected)# |Integral [small]#(No alteration is tolerated)#

|**Application source code** | | | | X
|**Generated official documents (e.g., tax notice PDF)** | | | | X
|===
====

[TIP]
====
Examples of associated mechanisms depending on the required integrity level:

- **Detectable** → Access logs and digital fingerprint (hash) verification.  
- **Controlled** → Version retention, auditability, automatic correction of detected errors.  
- **Integral** → Encryption, digital signatures, synchronous replication, immutable storage (WORM).

### Confidentiality Requirements

[TIP]
====
Confidentiality is the guarantee that information **is accessible only to authorized individuals** (ISO 27018 definition).

**Best practices**:  

- Do not multiply data classes unnecessarily. A single classification may be sufficient for the entire application.  
- Ensure that confidentiality levels are **consistent with legal and contractual requirements**.  

.Required confidentiality level by data class (example)
[cols="e,e,e,e,e"]

|===
====

[TIP]
====
**Examples of applying confidentiality levels**:

- **Public** → Web pages accessible without login.  
- **Limited** → Information restricted to authenticated users (e.g., SaaS dashboard).  
- **Restricted/confidential** → Sensitive internal data (e.g., system logs not accessible to customers).  
- **Private** → Personal data visible only to the concerned user (e.g., payslip).

### Identification Requirements

[TIP]
====
Identification makes it possible to **assign a unique identifier** to each user in order to distinguish them from others.  

**Note:** Identification **does not guarantee** that the user is who they claim to be. That is the role of authentication (e.g., password, MFA, etc.).  
====

.Identification requirements
[cols="1e,3e"]
|===
|Requirement |Description

|**Unique identifier**  
| Each user must have a **unique and non-shareable** identifier. A personal email address is a good example of such an identifier.  

|**Identity validation**  
| The existence of a user’s identity must be verified before any service call.  

|**Identifier permanence**  
| An identifier must **never be deleted, modified, or reused**, even after a user account has been removed.  
|===

[TIP]
====
**Best practices**:  

- **Favor stable and unique identifiers** (email, customer number, UUID, etc.).  
- **Avoid re-assignable identifiers** (e.g., incremental numeric IDs that may be reused after account deletion).  
- **Ensure identifier consistency** across all systems where it is used.  
====

### Authentication Requirements

[TIP]
====
Authentication verifies that a user is indeed who they claim to be, by validating their identity through one or more factors of proof.

⚠ **Do not confuse with identification**, which only distinguishes one user from another without validating their identity.

**Special cases**:  

- **Technical accounts** (e.g., batch jobs, applications, APIs) also require authentication (e.g., service accounts using certificates or SSH keys).  
- **Privileged accounts** (e.g., `root` on servers, application administrator accounts). These can be human or technical but can read/write/delete large volumes of data or perform irreversible operations (large blast radius).  
- **Initial authentication** (during registration) is often stricter than subsequent logins.  
- **Federated authentication** allows delegating authentication to an identity provider (SSO, OAuth2, SAML, etc.). See the next section.  
====

//🏷{"id": "58bf95ee-2fc4-4972-ac2b-7e2f775a4eb9", "labels": ["detail_level::detailed"]}
#### Authentication Requirements by Use Case

[TIP]
====

**Best practices**:  

- **Avoid password-only authentication** → always prefer at least a second factor (OTP, biometrics, etc.).  
- **Use proven standards** → FIDO2, WebAuthn, TOTP, SAML, OpenID Connect.  
- **Secure service accounts** → avoid static passwords; prefer SSH keys, certificates, or JWT tokens.  
- **Manage revocation and renewal** → implement mechanisms to regenerate a factor if lost or compromised.  

Example:

[cols="e,e,e,e,e,e,e"]
|===
|Authentication Case

### Identity Federation Requirements

[TIP]
====
Identity federation allows a user to **reuse their credentials** managed by an **Identity Provider (IdP)** to authenticate across multiple independent systems.

Unlike **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, which ensures automatic login without re-entering credentials, federation **does not bypass authentication** but centralizes identity management.

**Common examples:**  

- **Login.gov (US)** → Based on OpenID Connect, it enables US citizens to access federal services (IRS, Social Security, etc.) using a single account.  
- **"Sign in with [Google | Facebook | GitHub]"** → Implemented via **OpenID Connect** or **OAuth2**, allowing the use of a third-party account for authentication on another platform.  

**Advantages of identity federation:**  

- **Simplifies account management** → Fewer credentials for the user to remember.  
- **Reduces maintenance costs** → Fewer password resets and less user management overhead.  
- **Improves security** → Centralizes authentication with a trusted IdP, enabling strong authentication and MFA integration.  
====

====
**Example Application**

User identification and authentication will be externalized to **Auth0**, an identity provider (IdP) supporting **OIDC, SAML, and OAuth2**.  

**Objectives**:  

- **Centralize identity management** and avoid duplication of user accounts.  
- **Reduce costs** related to authentication development and operations.  
- **Enhance security** by delegating authentication to a standards-compliant IdP.  
====


//🏷{"id": "400376ad-cc62-4ab3-8e96-5a9f9a954e49", "labels": ["level::advanced", "level::advanced"]}
### SSO and SLO Requirements

[TIP]
====
**Single Sign-On (SSO)** allows a user to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without re-entering credentials.  
**Single Log-Out (SLO)** ensures that logging out of one application automatically logs the user out of all other applications within the same trust domain.

**Key considerations:**

- **SSO can be complex** to implement, especially if an Identity Provider (IdP) infrastructure is not yet in place.  
- **Applications must be compatible** with the chosen protocol (SAML, OIDC, Kerberos, etc.).  
- **The business need must be justified** → An application used infrequently may not require SSO.  
- **Security risk** → A **weak authentication method** for one SSO-enabled application compromises the entire system (e.g., one weak password can expose all applications accessible via SSO).  

**Best practices:**

- Define **limited trust boundaries** (e.g., SSO only for internal applications).  
- Use **strong authentication (MFA)** to reduce impersonation risks.  
- Properly manage **sessions and token expirations**.  
- Consider **simpler centralized authentication (LDAP, CAS)** if full SSO is not justified.  
====

====
**Example 1: No need for SSO**  
The application portal relies on a JSR352 framework that already manages single authentication. No additional SSO required.  
====

====
**Example 2: No SSO or SLO required**  
The application runs autonomously and does not share authentication with other services.  
====

====
**Example 3: SSO required for an intranet environment**  

- Once authenticated on one intranet application, the user must **not be required to re-authenticate** on other applications until the session expires.  
- A **logout (SLO)** from one application must trigger **logout from all other applications** in the trust domain.  
- The chosen protocol will be **OIDC with the on-prem Keycloak Identity Provider**.  
====

### Non-repudiation requirements
[TIP]
====
Non-repudiation ensures that a user or an organization cannot deny having performed a specific action (signature, approval, transaction, etc.).
It generally relies on cryptographic mechanisms, particularly digital signatures and secure timestamping.

**Typical use cases:**  

- Signing of **contracts and legal commitments**.  
- Validation of **sensitive financial transactions**.  
- Submission of **official documents** (e.g., tax returns, notarized acts).  


**Regulatory references:**  

- **United States** → The **ESIGN Act** (Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act) and **UETA** (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) establish the legal validity of electronic signatures.  
- **European Union** → The **eIDAS Regulation (EU 910/2014)** defines the framework for electronic identification and trust services, including **qualified electronic signatures** with strong non-repudiation guarantees.  


**Non-repudiation requirements by use case (example)**

### Anonymity and privacy requirements
[TIP]
List the constraints of anonymity and legal privacy.
====
Example 1: No data consolidation should be possible between data in the PERSON domain and in the HEALTH domain.
====
====
Example 2: For the sake of confidentiality in the event of a computer intrusion, some personal data will be redacted before replication into the public area: cholesterol level and weight.
====
====
Example 3: No racial, political, union, religious or sexual orientation data can be stored in any form whatsoever in the IS.
====
====
Example 4: The OpenData data from the “housing” domain will only contain consolidated data at the common level, not more precise.
====
====
Example 5: In application of a European directive, a banner must inform the user of the presence of cookies.
====
====
Example 6: Pursuant to the GDPR, explicit consent from users to store their personal health data will be offered.

### Authorization Requirements

[TIP]
====
An authorization (or permission) controls **access to a specific application function** (also called a **privilege** or **entitlement**) for a user or a group of users.

**Examples of application functions:**

- "Execute an interbank transfer"  
- "View account history"  
- "Delete a user"  

⚠ It is recommended **not to create excessive numbers** of functions and roles in order to avoid combinatorial explosion and high management overhead.

Two main access control models are commonly used:

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**  
  Users are grouped into roles (e.g., `Administrator`, `Manager`, `User`) that determine their permissions. This is simple and widely used.

- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control):**  
  Access decisions are based on user attributes, resource attributes, and context (e.g., *“allow access if role=Manager AND location=US AND time < 6PM”*).  

- **PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control):**  
  A broader term that often builds on ABAC, allowing complex authorization policies defined in policy engines (e.g., **OPA – Open Policy Agent**).  

In mid-2020s, many organizations use a **hybrid model**, where **RBAC handles baseline roles** and **ABAC/PBAC adds fine-grained, contextual rules**.  

**Best practices for simplifying authorization management:**

- **Group** users into **groups** (e.g., `G_department_head`).  
- **Associate** a list of **functions/permissions** with a **role** (e.g., `R_Administrator`, `R_banker_level1`, `R_department_head`).  
- **Assign** roles to **users or groups** for better maintainability.  

**Classic role-based access control (RBAC) model:**  

image::diagrams/roles.svg[Classic role-based access management]

**Predefined users and roles:**  
Be sure to specify generic user categories such as:

- **`@anonymous`**: unauthenticated users.  
- **`@authenticated`**: authenticated users.  

**Delegated authorization (OAuth2, etc.):**

If the application **delegates or consumes** authorizations via an **external system (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, etc.)**, it is necessary to specify:

- **Is the application an authorization provider or consumer?**  
- **Which types of authorizations are involved?**  
====

====
Example 1: **Unauthenticated users** will only have **read-only privileges**.  
====

====
Example 2: The application will use a **matrix-based authorization management system** based on **[roles] → [groups or users]**.  
Details of authorizations will be documented in the **Detailed Functional Specifications (DFS)**.  
====

### Traceability and auditability requirements
[TIP]
====
List here the trace requirements for detecting, for example:
* Misuse of back-office applications by employees
* Computer intrusions
* Data alteration
The traces are nominative and complete to allow auditing. They are therefore themselves sensitive and often require a good level of confidentiality.
Differentiate:
* Application traces, i.e., assessments of a complete use case such as 'Agent X consulted Ms. Y's file' and that are stored in databases;
* ... and the application traces (logs) as in a log file: `[INFO] 2016/12/23 11:14[Agent X] Call of the consult service` which are of technical level and much more volatile.
====
For the most sensitive data, it is possible to provide traceability at two levels (tracing the consultation of traces) to avoid abusive hierarchical traceability.
The traceability of the data of the repositories (base of people typically) requires a complete historization, which is in any case a good practice. To do this, provide an MCD allowing a record to be added for each change with a modification date and an effective date.
====
Example 1: for module X, any business action (update or consultation) must be the subject of a application trace containing at least the agent, the date and in case of modification the previous and the new value.
====
====
Example 2: Any intrusion into the IS must be detected (as far as possible).
====
====
Example 3: We need to be able to reconstruct the history of any patient's record at any date.

### Identification

[TIP]
====
Describe here the method of identification for users and systems (batch jobs, APIs, external services).  
Specify the identification attributes and the mechanisms that guarantee the **uniqueness** and **persistence** of identifiers.  
====

====
Example 1: User identifiers will be the `uid` attribute of the DNs `cn=XXX,ou=service1,dc=company,dc=com` in the central LDAP directory.  
A filter will also be applied to restrict access to members of the group `ou=myapplication,dc=company,dc=com`.  
====

====
Example 2: To prevent the reuse of identifiers from deleted accounts, a history table `uid_history` will be added to the database and systematically checked before any new account creation.  
====

====
Example 3: Service accounts will be identified via a unique API key stored in a **secure Vault** and rotated automatically every 6 months.  
====

//🏷{"id": "ac587042-7060-44cf-96aa-93fddadc15f5", "labels": [], "link_to": ["9d0646cd-3e3f-4878-96de-f215c9f20bdc"]}
### Authentication

[TIP]
====
Describe here the authentication mechanisms in place, including:  
- The method of password storage and verification.  
- Any additional authentication factors.  
- The lifecycle management of credentials (creation, update, deactivation).  
====

**Password-based authentication:**

====
Example 1: Registered users will authenticate via **username/password**, in compliance with password policy `P`.  
Passwords will be hashed and stored as **bcrypt digests with a cost factor of 12**.  
====

====
Example 2: Internal administrators will use **Kerberos-based SSO** with delegation through an OAuth2/OpenID Connect Identity Provider.  
====

====
Example 3: To enable account recovery, users will be able to reset their password via a **temporary email link** (valid for 10 minutes).  
====

**Strong authentication (2FA/MFA):**

====
Example 4: When adding a new wire transfer beneficiary in the online banking portal, the user must provide:  

  - Their regular password.  
  - An **OTP** generated by a TOTP application (Google Authenticator, FreeOTP, etc.).  
====

====
Example 5: Access to critical REST APIs will require **API key + signed JWT authentication**.  
API keys will be stored in a **Vault** and rotated automatically.  
====

**Securing sensitive authentications:**

====
Example 6: All failed authentication attempts will be **logged and monitored**.  
After **5 consecutive failures**, the account will be **temporarily locked for 30 minutes**.  
====

====
Example 7: Suspicious logins (new IP address, unusual location) will require **additional verification via OTP sent by email**.  
====

### Identity Federation

[TIP]
====
The most common solutions currently are:

- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: a modern protocol built on OAuth 2.0, well-suited for web and mobile applications.  
- **SAML**: mainly used for enterprise SSO (e.g., ADFS, Shibboleth, Okta).  
- **OAuth 2.0**: only for **authorization**, not authentication (pseudo-authentication possible via an additional IdP).  

For web applications, specify **browser-related constraints** (cookie handling, SameSite policy, etc.).  
====

====
Example: The public-facing user interface will support identification and authentication via **Login.gov** (US federal identity service, based on OpenID Connect).  
Users will be able to log in using their existing accounts from trusted government agencies (e.g., IRS, Social Security).  
====


//🏷{"id": "1c4774ab-e6fc-46a4-bb89-97e318a8dd8f", "labels": ["level::advanced", "level::advanced"],"link_to:":["400376ad-cc62-4ab3-8e96-5a9f9a954e49"]}
### SSO and SLO

[TIP]
====
Describe here the chosen technology and its integration within the architecture.  
Some common solutions:  

- **CAS** (Central Authentication Service)  
- **Keycloak**  
- **ForgeRock OpenAM**  
- **LemonLDAP::NG** (open source)  
- **Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity** (widely used in enterprises)  

Be sure to specify web-specific constraints, including **cookie management**, **session tokens**, and the implications of **SameSite / CORS** policies.  
====

====
Example 1: The X user interface will integrate a **CAS Spring Security client** for SSO.  
The CAS server used will be **YYY**, with the **authentication realm** connected to **Active Directory (AD) Y**.  
====

====
Example 2: Like all applications in the **business portal**, the X user interface must implement **Single Logout (SLO)** by **handling logout callbacks** from the CAS server.  
====

====
Example 3: SSO will be implemented via **Keycloak** as the identity provider, with delegation to Active Directory via **LDAP**.  
====

### Service Accounts

[TIP]
====
**Service accounts** are used to authenticate an application or a batch job when accessing an infrastructure service (database, API, etc.).

**Best practices:**

- **Secure storage** of credentials (avoid storing secrets in plain text within configuration files).  
- **Automatic rotation** of secrets where possible (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  
- **Minimal permissions** following the **Principle of Least Privilege**.  

.Service accounts (examples)
[cols='1,2,2']
|===
|Account | Resource requiring authentication | Credential storage method

|`jdbc_app` | PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases | **Stored as a Kubernetes Secret** (mounted as a volume only on the relevant pods)  
|`api_backend` | REST API X | **Authentication via signed JWT stored in a secure secrets vault**  
|`ci_cd_runner` | CI/CD server | **Stored in HashiCorp Vault with automatic secret rotation**

### Non-repudiation and Timestamping

====
Example: The tax declaration will be signed using the user’s client certificate (*X.509*, *RSA*, *SHA-256*) issued by organization X.  
====

[TIP]
====
**Cryptographic timestamping** is not a standalone requirement but is most often used **together with a digital signature** to ensure non-repudiation.  
Timestamping prevents any **alteration of dates** (*backdating or postdating*).  

It relies on **qualified timestamp tokens** (*RFC 3161, eIDAS in EU*) issued by a **trusted timestamping authority (TSA)**.  
In the US, this role may be provided by **trusted CAs** or services compliant with **NIST digital signature and timestamping standards**.  
====

====
Example: Digital signatures will be **timestamped** with a **qualified timestamp token**, issued by a **trusted timestamping authority (TSA) such as provider XYZ**.  
====

### Anonymity and Privacy
====
Example 1: An **annual internal audit** will be conducted on:

- The **content of the databases**.  
- The **data extracts** shared with external partners.  
====

====
Example 2: Publicly exposed data will be **partially exported** using:  
`COPY (SELECT <allowed_columns> FROM table) TO <file>`  
**Sensitive columns will be excluded** from replication to the public zone.  
====

====
Example 3: A **cookie consent banner** will be implemented on all **Angular** application pages using the `angular-cookie-law` module.

### Authorization (Access Rights)

====
Example 1: **Authorization management** will be implemented **at the application level** and stored in the **PostgreSQL database**.  
The tables dedicated to access rights will be detailed in the **specification dossier**.  
====

====
Example 2: Access to **address books** will be controlled via **OAuth2**.  
The API used will be **Google OAuth2 in Java**.  
====


//🏷{"id": "3819b8cc-d9c4-4d29-9ca1-adae300a79e2", "labels": ["level::intermediate"],"link_to":["e72e5ea5-5711-4665-8a91-76c63cbca2bc"]}
### Traceability and Auditability

====
Example 1: At the end of each **business action**, the **ReactJS** application will perform an **asynchronous call** to a dedicated REST service for **action traceability**.  
This service will store the **business traces** in an **Elasticsearch database** for consultation via **Kibana**.  
====

====
Example 2: A hybrid **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** (*network + host*), based on **Wazuh**, will be **deployed on all machines** used by the application.  
====

====
Example 3: The **tables X, Y, …** will be **versioned (historized)** according to the following model: +  
<class diagram describing data version retention>  
====

====
Example 4: All documents **serving as evidence** will be archived in the **Document Management System (DMS)** with metadata to allow indexing and fast retrieval.  
====

====
Example 5: Logs **containing the tag `[EVIDENCE]`** and originating from **all modules** will be:

- **Centralized** via the **Elasticsearch** log system.  
- **Transformed and enriched** with **Logstash**.  
- **Indexed daily** in the **Elastic `evidence` index** to facilitate searches and ensure compliance.

### Cyberthreat Mitigation

Cyberthreats include: malware, phishing, DoS/DDoS attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities (known or zero-day), social engineering, online fraud, data leaks, ransomware, etc.

The response framework can be aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)**, which defines six core functions:

1. **Govern**: Establish governance, roles, and responsibilities for cybersecurity.  
2. **Identify**: Understand and prioritize risks.  
3. **Protect**: Implement defense mechanisms.  
4. **Detect**: Identify ongoing attacks.  
5. **Respond**: Contain and neutralize threats.  
6. **Recover**: Restore services after an attack.
