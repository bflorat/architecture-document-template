== Introduction
This is the infrastructure point of view of the application. It describes the deployment of application modules in their target execution environment and all the devices ensuring their proper functioning.

The other views of the document are accessible link:./README.adoc[from here].

The project glossary is available link:glossary.adoc[here]. We will not redefine the functional or technical terms used here.
